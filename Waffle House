        <blockquote>
          As with other open-all-night eateries (including White Castle, Krystal, Denny's, Steak 'n Shake, and Krispy Kreme, as well as convienence store chain Sheetz), Waffle House has developed into a cultural icon. Part of their fame (especially that of Waffle House) is that they are so prominent along Interstate highways in the South. Jim Ridley wrote in 1997:
          "The Waffle House is everywhere in the South. It has inspired country songs, comedy routines, loving editorials, a scene in the movie Tin Cup, and even web sites and Internet newsgroups that breathlessly post late-breaking developments. With more than 1200 locations in 20 states, as far north as Ohio and as far west as Arizona, Waffle House is cherished by thousands of diners. Regular customers speak of its employees, its customs, and its food with near reverance. Touring musicians have been known to eat five meals a week there. Yet the Waffle House is so pervasive, it is invisible. It does not advertise; it hides in plain site[32]"

      <h2>
        Where did Waffle House come from?
      </h2>
      <p3>
        The first Waffle House opened on Labor Day weekend in 1955 at 2719 East College Avenue in Avondale Estates, Georgia.[2] That restaurant was concieved and founded by Joe Rogers  Sr. (1919-2017) and Tom Forkner (1918-2017). [2] [5] Rogers started in the restaurant business as a short-order cook in 1947 at the Toddle House in New Haven, Connecticut. [6] By 1949, he became a regional manager [3] with the now-defunct Memphis-based Toddle House chain, then he moved to Atlanta.
